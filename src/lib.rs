//! # Introduction
//! The LINE Messaging API SDK for Rust makes it easy to develop bots using LINE Messaging API, and you can create a sample bot within minutes.
//! # Documentation
//! See the official API documentation for more information.
//! - English: <https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/overview/>
//! - Japanese: <https://developers.line.biz/ja/docs/messaging-api/overview/>
//! # Requirements
//! This library requires Rust nightly.
//! # Installation
//! ```
//! [dependencies]
//! line-bot-sdk-rust = "0.1"
//! ```
//! # Configuration
//! ```
//! extern crate line_bot_sdk_rust as line;
//! use line::bot::LineBot;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let bot = LineBot::new("<channel secret>", "<channel access token>");
//! }
//! ```
//! # How to use
//! The LINE Messaging API uses the JSON data format.
//! parse_event_request() will help you to parse the HttpRequest content and return a Result<[Events](`events::Events`) , &'static str> Object.
//! ```
//! let result: Result<Events, &'static str> =
//!     bot.parse_event_request(signature, body);
//! ```
//!
//! ```
//! match result {
//!     Ok(events) => {
//!         for event in events.events {
//!             ...
//!         }
//!     }
//!     Err(msg) => {}
//! }
//! ```
